# Star Wars: The Jedi Trials

The game started out as solely a mortal kombat style game just like any other copy. 

Then my love for Star Wars took over and ideas came flowing to me and I couldn't bear to risk forgetting any of them.

So here's a Road Map of the game's development so you can follow my progress:

1. finish boilerplate code
2. change assets to star wars related assets
3. add character selection
4. add multiple character skins
5. add separate character classes, weapons, kit
- lightsaber wielders block, use the force, deactivate lightsaber (block turns into force dodge-back?)
- blaster users dodge back, duck, use items
6. special fights that use multiple stages
- anakin (play as obi wan, set on mustafar, end cutsene?), vader, (play as) force vision vader (against force vision'd palpatine), end cutscene from comics?
- senator palpatine, chancellor palpatine, emperor palpatine (play as anakin, switch to vader)
- phantom menace maul, mechanical spider maul, mechanical legs maul, end-of-clone-wars maul, old maul (play as obi wan, changes to old ben)
7. custom asset imports: characters, background
8. potentially add a story mode
9. maybe even multiversal expansions to other franchises... o.O
